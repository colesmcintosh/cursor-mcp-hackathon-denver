You are developing a new FastMCP server in Python. Use the fastmcp package to:

1. Register any MCP tools your workflow needs.
2. Expose relevant resources using `@app.resource` with helpful markdown.
3. Provide prompts that give Cursor users clear next steps for interacting with your server.

Expectations:
- Validate and parse JSON arguments with Pydantic models or dataclasses.
- Return structured results that Cursor can render cleanly.
- Keep the server stateless when possible so it restarts reliably.
- Add inline comments where the implementation could benefit from quick context.

Start by outlining the serverâ€™s responsibilities, then implement each tool and resource. Include lightweight tests or manual verification steps where practical so the server is demo-ready.
